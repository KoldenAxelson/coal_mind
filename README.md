## Features

- ðŸ“š 13 popular machine learning algorithms
- ðŸŽ“ Educational-focused implementation
- ðŸ’¡ Clear, well-documented code
- ðŸš€ Simple API design
- ðŸ“– Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Implemented Algorithms

### Supervised Learning
1. **Linear Regression** - For predicting continuous values
2. **Logistic Regression** - For binary classification
3. **K Nearest Neighbors** - Instance-based learning
4. **Support Vector Machines** - For classification with maximal margin
5. **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classifier
6. **Decision Trees** - Tree-based decision making
7. **Random Forests** - Ensemble of decision trees
8. **Boosted Trees** - Gradient boosting implementation
9. **Neural Networks** - Simple feedforward neural network

### Unsupervised Learning
10. **K Means Clustering** - Partition-based clustering
11. **Hierarchical Clustering** - Tree of clusters
12. **DB Scan** - Density-based clustering
13. **Principal Component Analysis** - Dimensionality reduction

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
coal_mind = "0.1.0"
```

## Quick Start

```rust
// to be implemented
```

## Educational Use

Each algorithm implementation includes:
- Detailed comments explaining the mathematics
- Step-by-step implementation notes
- Performance considerations

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains standalone examples for each algorithm:

```bash
cargo run --example linear_regression
cargo run --example kmeans
# ... etc
```
